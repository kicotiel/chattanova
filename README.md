## Hi there :)


This is a nifty little mod that splits (future) configurable chats from the standard chat box into a second chat box.<br>
That's about it!

## TO-DO:
- **BUGFIX: Remove reliance on listMerger to prevent excessively long words from being broken up with an unnecessary space**
- **Add filter configuration**
- **Add a fancy UI**
- **Add some functionality to create multiple windows each with different filters**
- Clean up some inconsistent behavior on a few edge cases
- Probably refactor the code 50 times since I'm brand new to Java + Forge
- Requests
